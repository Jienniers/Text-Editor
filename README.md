## Description

**GS Text Editor** is a personal project aimed at building a simple yet feature-packed text editor for Windows. I wanted a tool that goes beyond basic notepad functionality — something that includes tools like a calculator, text-to-speech, music playback, and theme customization — all in one place. This project is my way of learning deeper C# Windows development while creating a utility I’d actually use.

## Features

* Create a new window
* Open existing text files
* Save and Save As functionality
* Print documents
* Preview Print before
* Built-in calculator
* Text-to-speech engine
* Add Images (though not with text just able to display images, images are included in print preview)
* Theme selection (light/dark)
* Built-in music player
* Customizable menu strip and toolbar
* Built in time display
* Customization with dedicated settings window

## Prerequisites

* Microsoft Windows (10)
* Visual Studio (2022 or newer)
